    "> You may be more familiar with defining points as $(x, y)$ rather than $(x_1, x_2)$. However, in machine learning it is much more convenient to define each coordinate using the same base letter with a different subscript. This allows us to easily represent a 100-dimensional point, e.g., $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_{100})$. If we use the grade school method, we would soon run out of letters!"
