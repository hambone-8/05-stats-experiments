> The Titanic survival dataset was chosen for this lesson because it is interesting, easy to understand, and commonly used in other tutorials. This dataset is also used in an official Kaggle tutorial (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), which might be useful for students who want to explore Kaggle or the dataset further.

## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, students will be able to:
- **Describe** characteristics and trends in a data set using visualizations.
- **Use** basic statistics to reduce the dimensionality of data.
- **Describe** the bias and variance of statistical estimators.
- **Identify** a distributions within a data set using summary statistics and data visualizations.
- **Understand** the Normal distribution and the concept of Normality.
- **Visualize** the normal distribution.
- **Understand** the uses of the 68-95-99.7 Rule and the z-score.
- **Visualize** the 69-95-99.7 Rule
- **Apply** z-scoring to data

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- **Explain** the purpose and steps in hypotehsis testing
- **Determine** causality and sampling bias using Directed Acyclic Graphs
- **Define** the null and alternative hypotheses.
- **Perform** a two-sample t-test.
- **Define** the t-statistics and p-value.
- **Identify** what missing data is and how to handle it
- **Test** a hypothesis using a sample case study

## Student Requirements

Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to:
- State the definition and application of an array in Python 
- Perform basic data manipulation and exploration in Pandas
- Recall basic tenants of linear algebra
